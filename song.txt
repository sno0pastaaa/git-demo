On the real cuz flip this, trip this
Nigga try to introduce me to my bitch
On the turf, I ain't drip saw the full dirt
Casanova, LaVert, revert
Back with another hit, better get another bitch
She's so playful, that bitch ain't faithful
Cus' I can name five different times
When the bitch went for hers, so I'm gonna get mine
I got four 'lacs, 5 Chevrolets, what it do
Even got a bulletproof, I'm tied in with the upper echelon
When you with me bitch, you get what you want
And you can bring a friend too, comment allez-vous
Little French dip for a bitch like you
Sucker punch, I don't think so
Well what do you know? When I pulled up, a little yellow bitch stood up
I threw the hood up
You know why?
That little bitch you like (That's My Work)
You know, that little shit you like (That's My Work)
Oh yea, you know I get you right (That's My Work)
Late night, I come and hit you right (That's My Work)
Bitch (That's My Work)
Work, work (That's My Work)
Work, work (That's My Work)
Work, work (That's My Work)
